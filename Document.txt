## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The research utilized three datasets from Kaggle to analyze college students' mental health through multimodal data, including text, images, and temporal sequences. The datasets were meticulously curated and preprocessed to ensure data quality and relevance. Key preprocessing steps included removing noise, normalizing textual data for consistency, and resizing images to 256x256 pixels to standardize input dimensions. This process ensured that the data fed into the model was clean, structured, and meaningful for accurate analysis.

## Model Architecture

The proposed model leverages advanced deep learning techniques to analyze and predict mental health using a combination of text, image, and temporal data:

##Text Model: BERT

# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) processes textual data, capturing the contextual relationships between words. BERT's bidirectional approach allows it to generate embeddings that reflect the sentiment and emotional nuances in the text.
Purpose: These embeddings are crucial for understanding textual indicators of mental health issues such as stress or anxiety.
Image Model: VGG16

# VGG16, a convolutional neural network (CNN), is employed to extract high-level features from images. It is effective at capturing subtle cues in images, such as facial expressions and body language.
Purpose: The embeddings generated by VGG16 provide a visual context that complements the textual data, offering a holistic view of the individual's emotional state.
Temporal Model: LSTM

# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to process time-series data, capturing temporal dynamics and trends over time.
Purpose: LSTM networks track changes in mental health indicators, allowing the model to understand how a student's mental state evolves.
Fusion with Attention Mechanism

# An attention mechanism is integrated into the model to selectively focus on significant features from each data modality while reducing noise. This improves the model's predictive accuracy by emphasizing relevant portions of the data.
Robust Evaluation

# Cross-Validation and Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. This ensures that the model generalizes well to new data and provides reliable predictions.
Trend Analysis: The model's ability to analyze mental health trends over time adds a layer of robustness, enabling proactive monitoring and intervention.
